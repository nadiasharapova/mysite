I first subset by data and after counting how they perceived their performance by gender, I noticed that women were the only ones who perceived their performance as ‘below average’ while men were the only ones who perceived their performance as ‘excellent.’\nI then wanted to see if there was a relationship between the two variables using a chi-squared test. I created a new dataframe where I changed the performance into a numeric ranking for analysis, though it was still a discrete variable. I then ran a chi-squared test and got a p-value of .006482, which was less than .05. This means that we must reject our null hypothesis (which was that there was no statistically significant relationship between gender and perceived performance).

    "text": "Age and Performance\nAfter looking into this data further, I wanted to evaluate and understand how age impacts different behavior frequencies in college. I created a new dataframe from my numeric data frame and selected the Age, Gender, Performance, Notes, Challenges, Presentations, and New variables. The behavior frequencies were calculated by converting the survey responses into numerical data where performance was evaluated as “Below average” = “1”, “Average” = “2”, “Good” = “3”, and “Excellent” = “4”. The variables for behavior frequencies (the Notes, Challenges, Presentations, and New variables) were calculated as “No” = “1”, “Sometimes” = “2”, “Yes” = “3”. This way, I could numerically understand the frequencies of certain behaviors.\nI then pivoted my data to show the frequencies of all of the behaviors together and then plotted the data. The figure below shows the frequencies of certain behaviors as well as the perceived levels of performance as the student aged. We can see mixed results, with older students having a lower perception of their performance as they age. The New variable also significantly decreased while the Presentation variable increased. Lastly, the Notes variable also appeared to decrease. Considering that the sample evaluated undergraduate students, it may be that older students, or those above the average age of 22.53, may have struggles that impact their performance and extended their undergraduate career. However, the reasons behind this shift are not able to be confidently evaluated in this study.\n\n\nCode\nfreq &lt;- c(\"No\" = \"1\", \"Sometimes\" = \"2\", \"Yes\" = \"3\")\n          \nd_numeric &lt;- d_numeric %&gt;%\n  mutate_at(vars(4:7, 10), ~str_replace_all(., freq) %&gt;%\n              as.numeric())\n\n\ndf_behaviors &lt;- d_numeric[, c(1,2,3, 4, 6, 7, 10)]\n\ndf_beh_longer &lt;-  pivot_longer(df_behaviors,\n                                 cols= c(3, 4, 5, 6, 7),\n                                 names_to = \"Behavior\",\n                                 values_to= \"Frequency\")\n\nggplot(\n  data = df_beh_longer,\n  mapping = aes(x = Age, y= Frequency, color= Behavior)\n) +\n  geom_smooth(method= \"lm\") +\n  labs( \n    title = \"Age and Self-Reported Behavior Frequencies\",\n     x = \"Age of Participant (years) \", y = \"Behavior Frequencies\",\n    color = \"Behavior\"\n  )\n\n\n`geom_smooth()` using formula = 'y ~ x'\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nprint(df_beh_longer %&gt;% \n  summarize(mean = mean(Age, na.rm = TRUE)))\n\n\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n   mean\n  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  22.5\n\n\nCode\nggplot(d, aes(x=Age, color=Gender))+\n  geom_density(alpha=.5) +\n  labs( \n    title = \"Age Across Sample\",\n     x = \"Age of Participant (years) \", y = \"Count\",\n    color = \"Gender\"\n  )"

Those with less than 6 friends reported more consistent depression and were less likely to have depression only sometimes.

In Computer Science, a STEM heavy field, we can see that students who face mental health struggles, older students, and women struggle with their perceptions of their performance. My data also shows that sleep and friendships have a significant impact on depression levels. This data implies that investing into services that include gender-based disparities and work to include older students is necessary. My data also supports the idea of investing further into helping students with mental struggles create healthier habits like sleep and friendships to address mental health struggles."
